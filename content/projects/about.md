## Publications elsewhere

### Honeycomb.io

[Effective Trace Instrumentation with Semantic Conventions](https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/effective-trace-instrumentation-semantic-conventions)

This started as a presentation to my engineering team on Semantic Conventions. I transformed it into an article to provide guidance and introduce tools to help improve attribute naming in OpenTelemetry tracing. The tools I've written: [honey-health](https://github.com/jerbly/honey-health) and [honey-explore](https://github.com/jerbly/honey-explore), correlate Semantic Convention definitions with Honeycomb datasets to provide useful insights.

### AWS

[Stream with Evertz SaaS playout platformâ€¯evertz.io](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/media/stream-with-evertz-saas-playout-platform-evertz-io/)

A co-written piece introducing the evertz.io SaaS. My section is "Evertz.io engineering" towards the end of the article where I present a few of our guiding principles, including: Serverless-first; High performance teams; and Observability-driven development.

### evertz.io

[Video Observability](https://evertz.io/blog/2022-09-22-video-observability)

A piece to explain the scalability challenges of traditional monitoring for broadcasters and to showcase our Machine Monitoring by Assertion (MMBA) system to easily handle this. I was awarded a US patent for MMBA in 2024.  

### Adafruit

[Learn - posts by jerbly](https://learn.adafruit.com/u/jerbly)

Two Raspberry Pi end-to-end guides that use Adafruit electronics. Sensors, screens, breadboards and Python code.

[Jeremy's Blog](https://jeremyblythe.blogspot.com/)

About 12 years of mostly Raspberry Pi projects: a couple of my favourites: [Raspberry Pi parking camera with distance sensor](https://jeremyblythe.blogspot.com/2013/03/raspberry-pi-parking-camera-with.html) and [Raspberry Pi midi driven solenoid bell](https://jeremyblythe.blogspot.com/2013/03/raspberry-pi-midi-driven-solenoid-bell.html).

In more recent years there were a couple ML projects including a very complete Azure based computer vision project to cheat at the game Quiddler: [Practical ML end-to-end project: labelling, training, inference, serverless deployment](https://jeremyblythe.blogspot.com/2021/02/practical-ml-end-to-end-project.html).

My final post on this archived site was a mid-pandemic project to control an On Air light for Zoom calls! [Raspberry Pi, Home Assistant controlled On Air Light](https://jeremyblythe.blogspot.com/2021/12/raspberry-pi-home-assistant-controlled.html)
